error[E0599]: the method `load_state` exists for mutable reference `&mut TestService`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

  = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `TestService: ServiceObject`
          which is required by `TestService: ObjectStateManager`
          `&mut TestService: ServiceObject`
          which is required by `&mut TestService: ObjectStateManager`
note: the trait `ServiceObject` must be implemented

  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following trait defines an item `load_state`, perhaps you need to implement it:
          candidate #1: `ObjectStateManager`
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `ManagedState` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
